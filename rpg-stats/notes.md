# Side Kicks
This section provides a simple way to add a special NPC - called a sidekick - to the group of an adventurers. These rules take a creature with a low challenge rating and give it levels in one of three simple classes: Expert, Spellcaster or Warrior. Start with a creature template and adjust stats based on level.

## Sidekick Class
Choose the class it will have for the rest of its career: 
- Expert
- Spell-Caster
- Warrior

## Levels
The starting level is the same as the average level of the group and gains levels with the group.

## Hit points
Whenever the sidekick gains a level, it gains one Hit Die, and its maximum increases. HP = Level x (hit die max + Con mod).
Sidekicks die or recover as player characters.

### Proficiency Bonus
Based on class table. Whenever the sidekick's proficiency bonus increases by 1, add 1 to attacks and ability DC's

###  Ability score increases
ASI's adjust stats accordingly.
